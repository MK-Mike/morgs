# Morgan Bay Climbing Guide Website

This project is create a modern, up to date climbing guide for Morgan Bay

## Acknowldgements

This project is only possible because of the hard work and time put in by Derek Marshal (legend of Eastern Cape Climbing) who was the first person to put together a climbing guide for Morgan Bay.
Without his hard work and dedication to documenting climbing rotue we would have nothing to work with. We are deeply thankful for his time and effort.

## Philosophy / Aim

A climbing guide should serve the needs of the climbing community. It should make it easy to search for and discover new routes as well as provide up to date information about access and conditions (eg broken holds, damaged bolts ). It should also help the community reach consensus on the difficulty of routes and allow for members of the community to give input and contribute to the ongoing maintainance of the body of knowledge.

Climbing guides should also be able to be downloaded or stored for offline use as connectivity is often an issue in climbing areas
